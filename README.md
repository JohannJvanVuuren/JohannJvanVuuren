âš¡ Fun fact: My academic background is scientific (Chemistry and Biochemistry), but I have decided to pursue a career in web development to work from home in a freelance capacity (initially), and to satisfy a life-long desire to work in software development. I have been working in clinical laboratory medicine up until now and have had to master numerous different software systems related to this specialisation which strengthend my already established interest in computer coding.
